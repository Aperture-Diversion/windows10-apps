# Windows10-Apps Removal Tool ![open issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/phoenix1747/windows10-apps.svg?style=for-the-badge)

This is a simple program to remove most of the preinstalled Windows 10 apps, that you cannot remove through a normal uninstallation.

For example you can remove the camera app, get started, windows maps and much more bloatware!

Just download it and give it a try. For the script to work you need to download the ```Batch``` *and* the ```Powershell``` script to the *same directory* and start the batch file with administrator priviliges.

With this script you can not only remove single apps but automatically remove any removable ones. Additionally, you can reinstall all of them if you wish. No network connection needed for the removal, however reinstallation requires internet access.
