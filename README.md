![latest version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/aperture-diversion/windows10-apps.svg) ![issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/aperture-diversion/windows10-apps.svg) ![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/aperture-diversion/windows10-apps/latest/total.svg)

This is a simple program to uninstall most of the Windows 10 apps, that you cannot remove through a normal uninstallation.

For example you can remove the camera app, "get started", windows maps and many more!



Just download it and give it a try. For the program to work you need to download the ```Batch``` *and* the ```Powershell``` script to the *same directory*.
